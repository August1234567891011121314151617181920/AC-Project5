I chose these classes because I like animals and it seemed like an easy way to make polyorphism happen. Animal is the base class and cat, dog, and alligator are the children
The methods I made pure virtual were animalCall, feedAnimal, redoAnimalWeight, and calculateHappiness. It makes sense to make these pure virtual because every animal needs this class so I could just override it instead of doing it from cratch every time.
Why did you choose this
demonstration of polymorphism? Justify that this is polymorphism using the four criteria from
the lecture slides.
I chose this demonstration of polymorphism because it is fun to see each of the animals make a virtual noise. IT definitely is polymorphism because it is inheritance(animal to dog/cat/alligator), at least two pointers are used in the vector to reference the parent type, the pointers point to the child classes of different types, and the animalCall method is called on all objects.
